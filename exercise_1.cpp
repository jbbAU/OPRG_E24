#include <iostream>

/*
Implement a program that prompts the user to input an integer, and subsequently determines the numbers sign and parity(even or odd). The program should present the following output:
 - "The number is positive and even."
 - "The number is positive and odd."
 - "The number is negative and even."
 - "The number is negative and odd."
 - "The number is zero.â€œ
Depending on the number of course
Hints:
Nested if statement can be used here.
To test an integer for parity, use the modulus operator %, which gives the rest in division. That is 7%3=1 because the rest is  1  23%3=2 because the rest 2. In this way
 x%2==0  if x is even og x%2!=0 if x is odd
